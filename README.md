# PRODIGY_CS_04
Created a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. 
Before running this code, ensure you have the pynput library installed (pip install pynput). This code sets up a listener to capture keyboard events. Each time a key is pressed, the on_press callback function is triggered, which appends the pressed key to the specified log file. The listener continues running until the 'Esc' key is pressed, at which point the program stops.
Remember to handle ethical considerations and obtain appropriate permissions before using or deploying a keylogger. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can lead to serious legal and privacy issues
